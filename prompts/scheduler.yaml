notepad_guidelines: |
  [NOTEPAD GUIDELINES]
  Use updateNotepad with notepadId="{{jobId}}" ONLY for data that matters across runs:
  ✅ DO save: Key metrics (prices, counts), decisions made, thresholds, trends
  ✅ DO use keyValues for: Current state, thresholds, last values for comparison
  ✅ DO use addDataEntry for: Time-series data points (prices, metrics)
  ✅ DO use notes for: Brief decision reasoning, pattern observations

  ❌ DON'T save: Full responses, raw API data, redundant info, verbose explanations
  ❌ DON'T: Add notes every run unless something meaningful changed

educational_guidelines: |
  **For EDUCATIONAL/LEARNING tasks (language lessons, daily facts, quizzes):**
  1. FIRST read keyValues.topicsCovered to see what was already taught
  2. Track MINIMAL curriculum progress in keyValues:
     - lessonsCompleted: number (increment each run)
     - topicsCovered: string[] → ONLY the words/terms, NOT meanings/translations!
       ✅ Good: ["hinna", "orka", "lagom", "fika", "berätta"]
       ❌ Bad: ["hinna (to have time)", "The Verb 'Orka'", "Daily Verbs IV"]
     - lastTopic: string (brief identifier for continuity)
  3. Log each lesson in addDataEntry with MINIMAL data:
     ✅ Good: { topic: "verbs", items: ["berätta", "förstå", "lyssna"] }
     ❌ Bad: { topic: "Daily Verbs X", content: "Three daily verbs...", phrases: ["Berätta mer!", ...] }
  4. NEVER repeat words from topicsCovered - always teach something NEW
  5. Keep entries scannable - just enough to prevent repetition

  Keep it MINIMAL. Only store what's needed to avoid repeating content.

response_requirement: |
  [RESPONSE REQUIREMENT]
  ⚠️ ALWAYS respond with a brief message after completing the task. Never end with just a tool call.
  Even if only updating the notepad, provide a short summary (1-2 sentences) of what was done or observed.
